# Product Matching on E-Commerce Platforms Spring 2022
• Group similar products via images by KNearestNeighbor labeling on the hidden features embedded from Siamese
neural networks.

• Group similar products via title by KNearestNeighbor labeling on the hidden features embedded from BERT models.

• Replicate the Triplet loss function to minimize the distance of positive pairs of examples while maximizing the distance of negative pairs of examples.

• Finetune the experiment with multiple backbones like ResNet, EfficientNet, and ViT and achieve a maximum
improvement of 11.16% on F1 score
